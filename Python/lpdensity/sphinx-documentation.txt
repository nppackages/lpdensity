# Setting up Python package documentation with Sphinx and readthedocs.
## Note: some of the commands in this may be specific to MacOS terminal.

# Install sphinx with
pip install -U Sphinx

# navigate to project root directory
# make a `docs` directory
mkdir docs

# move into docs directory
cd docs

# set up documentation with 
sphinx-quickstart

	separate source and build directories? y
	project name: [package name]
	author: [name]
	project release: [project version]
	project lang: [enter]

# now to edit conf.py
cd source

# open conf.py
# uncomment the sys lines
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.')) 

# edit abspath to source directory (where all .py files for the project are located), this will typically be '../../src/[packagename]'

# add extensions
sphinx.ext.autodoc
sphinx.ext.napoleon

# set html theme to
sphinx_rtd_theme

# Make .rst files corresponding to each page inside source/
 index.rst 
 [module].rst

** all general documentation should be added to .rst files. Only function-depedent documentation should be pulled from *.py files.

# in index.rst add:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
  
   modules


# to add python documentation to a page, in the .rst file add
.. autodoc:: [path.to.module] #typically looks like [packagename].[modulename]
   :members: # includes all documented functions/classes
   :undoc-members: #includes all undocumented functions/classes

# additional tools on Sphinx:

# additional information on writing .rst files

# to make html files
# inside the `docs` directory run
make html

# note: this compiles from the package created -- any documention in the .py files that needs updating will require a re-compilation of the package. Re-install and then run `make html` to update.

# to make pdf files
# inside the `docs` directory from the terminal run
make latexpdf 
# note: this pdf is not very nicely formated.
# use html whenever possible.

**use `make clean` to clear all html/latex output. this is necessary when make html or make latexpdf produces an error.

# instructions on adding to readthedocs from GitHub.
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html

# have a requirements.txt file with names of packages that 
# are used in your package uder Python/[packagename]

# need to have a .readthedocs.yaml file
# in the main folder
# follow the instructions here
