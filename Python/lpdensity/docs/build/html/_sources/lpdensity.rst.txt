lpdensity 
=================
Local Polynomial Density Estimation and Inference

Description
-----------
``lpdensity`` implements the local polynomial regression based density (and derivatives) estimator proposed in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2020).  Robust bias-corrected inference methods,
both pointwise (confidence intervals) and uniform (confidence bands), are also implemented
following the results in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2020, 2021a).
See Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2021b) for more implementation details and illustrations.

Companion command: ``lpbwdensity`` for bandwidth selection.


Details
-------
Bias correction is only used for the construction of confidence intervals/bands, but not for point
estimation. The point estimates, denoted by *f_p*, are constructed using local polynomial estimates
of order *p*, while the centering of the confidence intervals/bands, denoted by *f_q*, are constructed
using local polynomial estimates of order *q*. The confidence intervals/bands take the form:
*[f_q - cv * SE(f_q) , f_q + cv * SE(f_q)]*, where *cv* denotes the appropriate critical value and *SE(f_q)*
denotes an standard error estimate for the centering of the confidence interval/band. As a result,
the confidence intervals/bands may not be centered at the point estimates because they have been bias-corrected.
Setting *q* and *p* to be equal results on centered at the point estimate confidence intervals/bands,
but requires undersmoothing for valid inference (i.e., (I)MSE-optimal bandwdith for the density point estimator
cannot be used). Hence the bandwidth would need to be specified manually when *q=p*, and the
point estimates will not be (I)MSE optimal. See Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2020a, 2020b) for details, and also
Calonico, Cattaneo, and Farrell (2018, 2020) for robust bias correction methods.

Sometimes the density point estimates may lie outside of the confidence intervals/bands, which can happen
if the underlying distribution exhibits high curvature at some evaluation point(s). One possible solution
in this case is to increase the polynomial order *p* or to employ a smaller bandwidth.
